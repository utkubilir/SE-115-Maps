I created this project to explore using GitHub more effectively and to reinforce the knowledge I gained in the process. It also served as my term project, in which I developed an algorithm that reads data from a file and calculates the fastest route between two points on a map. Throughout this endeavor, I discovered new aspects of Java fundamentals and gained invaluable experience that elevated my coding practice. As a result, I deepened my understanding of both GitHub and Java, ultimately contributing to my professional growth.
